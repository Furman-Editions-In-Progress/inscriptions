CEX Editions of Inscriptions

### Diplomatic 
The goal of the diplomatic edition of a text is to accurately replicate what the actual looks like in the inscription or on the piece of papyri. A true to text edition is important because it removes and bias in changes made by future authors.  
Because the diplomatic edition is true to the original text it includes any parts of the inscription that are missing due to damage. Latin engravings are all in upper case letter and include many abreviations and the diplomatic edition shows this. 

### Leiden
The Leiden edition of a text gives the reader more information about the state of the text. It takes the diplomatic edition and begins to make it more clear by annotating the text using the leiden conventions. This includes filling in any abbreviations using normal parenthesis ,(), and making assumptions about missing parts of the inscription, incluing these with square brackets, []. Because the inscription is not always clear this is the first edition that is editorialized. For unclear sections dashes within brackets show that the author does not want to make a decision on what is missing because there is not enough contextual information or physcial marks left. 

### Normalized
The normalized latin or greek just simplifies the leiden convention into easier to read text. This is very useful for searching on computers as you do not need to know anything about the state of the text in order to search for particular words or phrases. 

### Translation
This is the simplest of the editions, just an english translation of latin or greek from the normalized edition. This is useful for serching by english words and easy reading of the inscriptions.
